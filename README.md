# Containerizing a Stack of mutiple services with Docker Compose - Example with ASP.NET Core API and Angular Frontend

A Sample Application to demonstrate implementing and integrating multiple docker services for communication using docker-compose. To demonstrate this, we take the case of an ASP.NET Core stack with a backend API which is consumed by a frontend Angular application.

# What is Docker Compose?

Docker-Compose is a configuration file which contains instructions for the Docker about how services should be built from respective Dockerfiles. While a Dockerfile aims at creating and customizing application containers by means of base images and instructions, the Docker-Compose file works on top of the Dockerfile and helps developers in running docker containers with complex runtime specifications such as ports, volumes and so on.
